- The [[Moore-Penrose]] algorithm is quite new to me: $$w = H^+y$$, where $$y$$ is target encode and $$H$$ is hidden features. However it simple explainable when trace back from [[least squares]] approximation, and $$H^+$$ is just the result from derivation equation of [[least squares]] w.r.t $$w$$
