- today I learn [[gemini]] python to replace openai in swarm framework. Gemini is carefully maintained by google with novel examples and cookbook. The point was that they released version 2.0 of gemini meanwhile its doc has not been fully updated.
	- It took me time to **read the old doc** without suspect
	- I replace openai by gemini but **do experiment on not a simple enough example**. I spend hours on it. Idiot!!!
