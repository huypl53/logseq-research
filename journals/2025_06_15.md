- while install zoom in arch, I got
	- ```
	  error: zoom: signature from "TNE tne@garudalinux.org" is unknown trust
	  :: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/zoom-6.4.13-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
	  ```
	- All I need to do is update `archlinux-keyring`
