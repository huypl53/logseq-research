	- edges: connect nodes
	- Conditional edges: decisions
- Concepts
	- Data/state: be tracked over time
		- Agent state is **accessible** to all parts of the graph
		- Be **local** to the graph
		- Can be stored in a persistence layer: can **resume** that state anytime

	- An AI agent can be represented as a graph. The core component of LangChain for this task is **GraphState**. When user sends messages, the messages are **forwarded to LLM**. LLM might need helps to look up something. LLM returns query to Graph, graph, if condition edge passes, route the query to **tool** by **take_action**
	- e.g: Agentic search tools
		- Init an agent consisting a graph of nodes which are **LLM and action**. LLM can make **decision to call the initiated tool or not.** Note that the tools are agent's attributes, LLM only **control the tool invocation**. In the action node, based on the decision of the LLM node, the graph invoke the tool then return the control back to LLM
