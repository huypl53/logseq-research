- Core actors
	- User
		- Human
		- Automated service
	- A2A client (client agent)
		- application, service, other AI agent
		- request **actions, information** from a remote agent
	- A2A server (remote agent)
		- an AI agent, agentic system
		- express **HTTP endpoint** implementing A2A protocol
		- **transparent** to client (client doesn't need to knows server's internal working, memory, tools)
- Interaction mechanisms
	- **Request/Response (Polling):**
		- The client **sends** a request (e.g., using the **`message/send` RPC method**) and **receives a response** from the server.
		- If the interaction requires a **stateful long-running task**, the server might initially respond with a **`working` status**. The client would then **periodically call `tasks/get`** to poll for updates until the task reaches a **terminal state** (e.g., `completed`, `failed`).
	- **Streaming (Server-Sent Events - SSE):**
		- For tasks that produce **results incrementally** or provide **real-time progress updates**.
		- The client **initiates** an interaction with the server using `message/stream`.
		- The server responds with an HTTP connection that remains open, over which it sends a **stream** of Server-Sent Events (SSE).
		- These events can be `Task`, `Message`, or ``TaskStatusUpdateEvent` (for status changes) or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` (for new or updated artifact chunks).
		- This requires the server to advertise the `streaming` capability in **its Agent Card**.

	- **Push Notifications:**
		- For **very long-running tasks** or scenarios where maintaining a **persistent connection** (like SSE) is impractical.
		- The client can provide a webhook URL when initiating a task (or by calling `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set`).
		- When the task status changes significantly (e.g., completes, fails, 
		  or requires input), the server can send an asynchronous notification (an
		  HTTP POST request) to this client-provided webhook.
		- This requires the server to advertise the `pushNotifications` capability in its Agent Card.

- Communication Elements
  collapsed:: true
	- Agent Card
		- **JSON describes an A2A server**
		- details: name, description, URL endpoint, authentication, capabilities (streaming or push notifications), specific **skills**, default input/output **modalities**
		- clients use Agent Card to discover agents and how to use
	- Task
		- client -> task -> server
		- lifecycle: `submitted`, `working`, `input-required`, `completed`, `failed`
		- **tasks are stateful and can involve multiple exchanges (messages)**
	- Message:
		- **single turn or unit of communication** with a Task
		- has role: `user` for client and `agent` for server
	- Part:
		- fundamental **unit of content** within a `Message` or an `Artifact`
		- types:
			- TextPart
			- FilePart
			- DataPart: json
		- e.g:
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```json
			  {
			          'message': {
			              'role': 'user',
			              'parts': [{'kind': 'text', 'text': text}],
			              'messageId': uuid4().hex,
			          },
			      }
			  ```
	- Artifact:
		- output generated by the remote agent **during the processing of a task**
	- **Context (`contextId`):**
		- A server-generated identifier that can be used to logically **group multiple related `Task` objects**, providing context across a series of interactions.
	- **Transport and Format:**
		- A2A communication occurs over HTTP(S). **JSON-RPC 2.0 is used as the payload** format for all requests and responses.
	- **Authentication & Authorization:**
		- A2A relies on standard web security practices. **Authentication requirements are declared in the Agent Card**, and credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens, API keys) are typically passed via **HTTP headers, separate** from the A2A protocol messages themselves.

	- **Agent Discovery:**
		- The process by which clients find Agent Cards to learn about available A2A Servers and their capabilities.
		- Learn more about [Agent Discovery](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/latest/topics/agent-discovery/).
	- **Extensions:** A2A allows agents to declare custom protocol extensions as part of their AgentCard.
