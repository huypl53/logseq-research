	- >Besides, maintaining the discrimination among seen classes is also essential to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
	- OnPro of **each class** $\mathbf{p}_i = \frac{1}{n_i}\sum\nolimits_j\mathbf{z}_j\cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_j = i\}$ is the **mean representation** in a mini-batch. After a session, we get a set of $K$ online prototypes $\mathcal{P} = \left\{ \mathbf{p}_{i} \right\} ^{K}_{i=1}$ from the batch data X (from dataset $\mathcal{D}_t$ of task $t^{th}$) and $K^b$ prototypes $\mathcal{P}^b$ from **the memory bank batch** $X^b$
	- OPE (Online protype equilibrium)
		- using a **contrastive loss** (#[[Contrastive Learning]]) learn representative features of each class by pulling online prototypes $\mathcal{P}$ and their augmented views $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ closer in the embedding space, and learn discriminative features between classes by pushing online prototypes of different classes away
	- Adaptive Prototypical Feedback (APF)
		- Specifically, APF adaptively **selects more samples from easily misclassified classes** in $\mathcal{M}$ (memory bank) for mixup according to the probability distribution matrix $P$. $P_{i,j}$ is small means that class $i, j$ is easily misclassified.
		- Firstly, select a portion of the replay data based on the distribution $P$. Secondly, uniformly sample from the rest of memory bank $\mathcal{M}$ to avoid **overfitting to easily misclassified classes**
