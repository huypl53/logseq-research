- Performance Mode (set at EFS creation time)
	- General Purpose (default) – latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc…)
	- Max I/O – higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
- Throughput Mode
	- Bursting – 1 TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s
	- Provisioned – set your throughput regardless of storage size, ex: 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage
	- Elastic – **automatically scales** throughput up or down based on your workloads
		- Up to 3GiB/s for reads and 1GiB/s for writes
		- Used for unpredictable workloads
- ## Storage Classes
	- Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature –move file after N days)
		- Standard: for **frequently accessed** files
		- Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, **lower price to store.**
		- Archive: r**arely accessed data** (**few times each year**), 50% cheaper
		- Implement **lifecycle policies t**o move files between storage tiers
	- Availability and durability
		- Standard: Multi-AZ, great for prod
		- One Zone: One AZ, great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA)
	- Over 90% in cost savings
