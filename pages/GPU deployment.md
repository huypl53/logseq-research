## Model format
	- tensorRT
		- **offers the highest inference performance on NVIDIA Jetson**
	- onnx
- ## Model optimization methods
	- Calibration
		- is the process of determining the **dynamic range** (minimum and maximum values) of activations in a neural network **to map floating-point values to INT8** without significant loss of accuracy
