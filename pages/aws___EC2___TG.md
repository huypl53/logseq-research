- Pros: traffic routing and health monitoring
- Could be:
	- A group contains a lot of [[aws/EC2]]
	- ECS tasks
	- [[aws/lambda]]
	- **private** IP addresses

	- **Static Workload**: You have a fixed set of EC2 instances (or other targets) that don’t need automatic scaling. Example: A small app with 2 manually managed EC2 instances.
	- **Manual Control**: You want to explicitly register/deregister targets (e.g., during testing or for non-EC2 targets like on-premises servers via IP).
	- **Non-EC2 Targets**: You’re routing traffic to Lambda functions (ALB only), IP addresses, or a mix of resources not managed by an ASG.
	- **Fine-Grained Routing**: You need multiple TGs for an ALB with rules (e.g., /api to one TG, /web to another), regardless of scaling.
