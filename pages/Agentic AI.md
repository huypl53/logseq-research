- ## Characteristics
  collapsed:: true
	- Deterministic
		- the output or behavior is entirely **predictable based on the input** and **the rules** governing the system
		- A deterministic AI agent will always produce the same output when given the same input, with **no randomness or variability involved**.
		- Usecases:
			- consistency and predictability are critical
			- rule-based systems
			-
- ## Examples
	- CSV Agent
	- Customer Support Agent

- ## Workflows
  collapsed:: true
	- Prompt chaining
		- Prompt chaining **decomposes a task** into a sequence of steps
		- Each LLM call processes the output of the previous
		- **Optional checks** on intermediate steps to ensure the process is still on track
		- Usecases:
			- generate outline of document -> check if the outline meets certain criteria -> write the document based on the outline
	- Routing
		- **Classifies an input and directs it** to specialized followup task
		- Usecases:
			- Routing easy/common questions to smaller models like Claude 3.5 Haiku 
			  and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet
			   to optimize cost and speed.
	- Parallelization
		- LLMs can **work simultaneously** on a task and have their **outputs aggregated** programmatically.
		- Variations:
			- **Sectioning**: Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel.
			- **Voting:** Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs.
	- Orchestrator-workers
		- central LLM **dynamically breaks down tasks**, **delegates them to worker LLMs**, and **synthesizes** their results.
		- Usecases:
			- you can't predict the **subtasks needed**, which is determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input
			- Coding products that make complex changes to multiple files each time.
	- Evaluator-optimizer
		- one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop.
		- Usecases:
			- have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value
- ## Patterns
- ## MAS design tips
	- **Clear Agent Roles**: Each agent will have a **distinct, non-overlapping responsibility** to avoid redundancy and ensure smooth handoffs.
	- **Improved Workflow**: A more **linear and adaptive workflow** to handle various user intents (e.g., product inquiries, order placement, personalized recommendations, and sentiment handling).
