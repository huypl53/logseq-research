- from library
	- functools
		- wraps
			- forward the source function name, metadata to wrapper
	- logging
	  id:: 67f38eb3-1f21-4518-9e86-3c629b3b6996
		- custom logger propagates log to `rootLogger`
			- to stop propagation, use `logger.propagate=False`
	- contextlib
		- Context Manager
			- defines the runtime
			- context to be established + `with` statement
			- handles entry into, exit from, the desired runtime context for execution of the block of code
			- A custom `Context Manager` object must implement `__enter__` (return [as Target]) and `__exit__` methods
		- ExitStack/AsyncExitStack
			- A context manager combines **other context managers and cleanup functions**, especially those that are optional or otherwise driven by input data **dynamically at runtime**
			- Their `__exit__` methods are called in `a reverse order` even if exceptions occur
			- Allows registering arbitrary cleanup functions, not just context managers
- generator
  collapsed:: true
	- $.send()
		- helps a bidirectional communication between caller and generator
		- caller uses $.send() to pass a value to generator
		- the passed value inside generator is defined: `sent = yield <something>`
- asyncio
  collapsed:: true
	- event loop
		- picks the most ready task from the task queue then run the picked task
		- when the task waits for another, pick the next one to process
	- awaitable object
		- an object that implement `__await__()` method, which returns an iterator (typically a generator-like object)
			- which the event loop uses to **suspend and resume** execution
		- types of awaitables
			- **Coroutines**
				- define by `async def`
				- must be awaited or scheduled (e.g via `asyncio.run()`)
				- when using `await`, coroutine yields control back to the event loop, wait for other **coroutine, task or awaitable** to complete
			- **Futures**: Low-level objects representing a **pending result** (e.g `asyncio.Future`)
			- **Tasks**: Wrapped coroutines scheduled in an event loop (e.g., created by `asyncio.create_task()`).
- helpful packages
	- hydra
		- Concepts
			- `defaults` list:
				- config
					- specified by the conf file name (*.yml) with[out] extension
					- config group
				- `_self_`
					- determines the relative position of `this` config in the Defaults List
			- packages
				- determines where the **content of each input config is placed in the output config**
				- is derived from `Config Group` by default
