- Serving Engine Ecosystem
	- **SGLang** (Best for Agents &amp; Multi-turn)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Pros: **structured response**
		- Core Feature: **RadixAttention**
			- Manages KV cache as a Radix Tree (Trie) instead of a hash table
			- Enables automatic, granular reuse of visual embeddings across requests
			- Achieves up to **6.4x higher throughput** for structured/agentic workloads [1]
		- Architecture Support
			- Supports **E/P/D** (Encode-Prefill-Decode) disaggregation [2]
			- Zero-overhead scheduler to hide Python runtime latency [3]
	- **vLLM** (Standard ; Robust)
		- Pros
			- superior for **outputs > prompts due to better memory handling.**
		- Core Feature: **PagedAttention**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Solves memory fragmentation (The 'Pizza Problem') [4]
			- Allows non-contiguous memory allocation for massive visual contexts
		- **Chunked Prefill**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Splits large image prefill phases into chunks mixed with decode phases [5]
			- Prevents 'latency spikes' (Inter-Token Latency) in continuous batching
		- **Automatic Prefix Caching (APC)**
			- Hash-based caching mechanism [6]
			- Less granular than RadixAttention but effective for exact prefix matches
	- **Deepspeed**
		- Pros
			- Excels in **long-prompt/short-output scenarios.**
			-
	- **LMDeploy** (High Throughput)
		- Pros
			-
		- Engine: **TurboMind**
			- C++ optimized inference engine delivering up to **1.8x** vLLM throughput [7]
			- Features **Persistent Batching** and Blocked KV Cache natively
			- Supports **4-bit KV Cache** quantization for massive context windows
	- **TensorRT-LLM** (Hardware Specialized)
		- **Disaggregated Serving**
			- Physically decouples Vision Encoder (Compute-bound) from LLM (Memory-bound) [8]
			- Uses **NIXL** (RDMA) for zero-copy tensor transfer between workers
		- **FP8 Optimization**
			- Native support for Hopper (H100) FP8 Tensor Cores
- Quantization Strategies
	- **The Modality Discrepancy**
		- Visual tokens exhibit significantly higher **entropy and variance** than text tokens [9, 10]
		- Standard text-based quantization (e.g., naive INT4) clips visual outliers, causing 'performance collapse'
	- Quantization backend
		- **FP16 / BF16** (Baseline)
		- **INT4 (AWQ)**
			- Recommended for VRAM-constrained setups (A10G/A100) [11]
			- Protects salient (high-magnitude) weights crucial for visual features
		- **FP8 (E4M3)**
			- Recommended for H100/L40S; preserves dynamic range better than INT8 [12]
		- **GPTQ** (limited but improving)
			- Often slower than AWQ in vLLM; risk of degradation in VQA tasks [13]
		- Many HF “quantized” models use **bitsandbytes**:
	- Notes
		- vLLM un-compatible:
			- load_in_4bit=True
				- This relies on:
				- PyTorch custom ops
				- runtime dequantization
				- 🚫 vLLM does not use PyTorch forward()      🚫 vLLM cannot intercept bitsandbytes ops
	- **Advanced Methods**
		- **LUQ** (Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit)
			- Keeps sensitive cross-attention layers at higher precision [10]
		- **Q-VLM**
			- Mines cross-layer dependencies to optimize quantization boundaries [14]
- Visual Token Reduction
	- **Dynamic Methods** (Recommended)
		- **DyRate**
			- Dynamically adjusts pruning rate during generation based on attention distribution [15]
		- **VScan**
			- Combines Global Scanning (structure) with Local Scanning (detail) [16]
		- **DART**
			- Prunes based on token duplication/similarity rather than attention scores [17]
		- **DyMU**
			- Dynamic Merging based on image complexity; training-free [18]
	- **Static/Risky Methods**
		- **FastV**
			- Prunes tokens with low attention scores in deep layers

	- **Video Optimization**
		- **PEVLM**
			- Block-wise parallel encoding; reduces attention complexity from quadratic to linear [20]
- Decoding Acceleration
	- **Medusa**
		- Adds multiple decoding heads to predict future tokens in parallel [21]
		- Achieves **2.2x - 3.6x** speedup; works well with frozen backbones
	- **ViSpec**
		- Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding
		- Injects compressed visual features into the draft model to prevent hallucinations [22]
