- Purpose
	- transfer knowledge from large, computationally expensive model to smaller models
	- reduce model size for real time application
	- infer on CPU
-
- Methods
	- response based: minimize **output diversity** of teacher and student
	- feature based: scale up student model to **compare intermediate features** between students and teacher
	- relation based: Relationships between data points. In a model, extract the relationship between its data point using methods like **distance loss** or **cosine loss**
- Loss function
	- Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence loss
	- CE loss
- Misc
	- pruning
	- quantization
	- encoder only
	- Temperature scaling: reduce the sharpness of a model's output probabilities -> high sharpness means that teacher model favor some class (so confident) rather than others, which results in student modes mainly focus on those preferred classes
