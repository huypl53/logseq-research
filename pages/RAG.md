- ## Techniques
	- Re-ranking
		- when using top-k, not always that the first scored document is the "best-fit", so a re-ranking model come in
		- models: bge-reranker, jina-reranker
		- DS: MS MACRO
	- Context filtering/selection:
		- TF-IDF, embedding similarity to select top-N parts
		- use MMR (maximum marginal relavance) to remove duplicated
	- Multi-query retrieval
		- generate more queries than just user question
	- Recursive retrieval
	- Smart chunking
	- Chunk size tuning
	- Metadata filtering
	- Hybrid search:
		- searching for **vector** and **keyword**
