		- `echo "DE: ${XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP:-N/A} | Session: ${DESKTOP_SESSION:-N/A} | Display Server: ${XDG_SESSION_TYPE:-N/A} | WM: $(xprop -root _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $5}' | xargs -I{} xprop -id {} _NET_WM_NAME 2>/dev/null | grep "WM_NAME" | cut -d'"' -f2 || echo "N/A")"`
	- Desktop environment (DE)
	  collapsed:: true
		- a complete, integrated suite of graphical tools and applications for user interaction
		- includes: window manager (WM), compositor, file manager, taskbar, Application launcher, system tray
		- e.g:
			- GNOME:
				- default in Ubuntu
				- resource-intensive
			- KDE plasma:
				- highly customizable, appealing, built-in tools
			- XFCE:
				- light weights, modular
				- great for old hardware
			- LXQt:
				- lighweight
		-
	- Window manager (WM)
	  collapsed:: true
		- controls the **placement, appearance, behavior** of application windows
		- be often core **component of DE** but can also be used **standalone for a minimal setup**
		- abilities:
			- resizing, moving, minimizing, maximizing windows
			- determine whether windows are **stacking/floating** (overlapping, like windows) or **titling** (arranged without overlap)
		- e.g:
			- **Stacking/Floating:** Openbox,
			- **Titling**: i3, bspwm
			- **Dynamic**: hyprland, sway
	- Display server
	  collapsed:: true
		- display server protocol defines how a graphical interface communicates between the OS, applications and hardware (monitor, keyboard, mouse..)
		- e.g:
			- x11
				- old, apps could snoop on others
			- wayland
				- more secure, preventing them from accessing each otherâ€™s data
				- Smoother animations and better handling of high-resolution displays.
				- the display server, window manager, and compositor (which handles window effects like transparency) are combined into a single program called a Wayland compositor (e.g., Sway, Hyprland, Mutter for GNOME).
	- Compositor
	  collapsed:: true
		- combines the roles of a display server, window manager, and compositor, running on the Wayland protocol
		- e.g:
			- Hyprland:
				- **Dynamic Tiling**
				- Highly customizable via ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf. You can set keybindings, window rules, and visual styles.
				- Dependencies: Requires tools like swayidle and swaylock for **idle management and screen locking.**
			- sway:
				- a **tiling** Wayland compositor as a drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager (which runs on X11)
	- Display manager
	  collapsed:: true
		- as a bridge between boot process and the user's graphical session
		- features:
			- log in to system
			- choose DE or WM
			- start Xorg/Wayland session
		- e.g:
			- sddm for hyprland
		- Usage:
			- Op1: enable sddm servier (`systemctl enable sddm`) then select Hyprland session
			- Op2: start sddm manually from a TTY
- ## To-make-it-run
	- audio
		- audio server
			- PulseAudio
				- pavucontrol: GUI version
			- pipewire-pulse
				- recommended for hyprland/wayland
				- emulates PulseAudio
				- tools:
					- `pactl list cards`
					-
		- alsa
			- `aplay -l`
