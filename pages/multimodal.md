- Visual Question Answering (VQA):A task in Machine Learning that aims to answer a question related to a given image.
- Transformer-based
- ## Concepts
	- unified attention:
		- concatenate image tokens and text tokens
	- cross-modality attention:
		- initial input is just text token
		- at each layer of decoder, encoder's K, V is updated to to make cross attention
	- ### test time-scaling compute performance
		- Multiple sampling
		- Longer response
			- Budget force
				- force model to **reason** more
				- When reaching <eos> toke, remove it then insert new toke like "wait, redo it" to force LLM continue reasoning
