- > Elastic Load Balancers
- Listen on port -> forward to a [[aws/EC2/TG]]
- Own fixed hostname
- Integration
	- EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
	- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
	- Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator
- Types
  collapsed:: true
	- deck:: AWS
	- ALB #card
		- > Application LB
		- support HTTP/2 and websocket
		- route to applications on same machine
		- route to HTTP application across machines (target groups)
			- based on URL query param, choose [[aws/EC2/TG]]
	- NLB
		- > Network Load Balancer
		- high-performance, low latency
		- have 1 static IP per AZ, support Elastic IP
	- GLB
		- > Gateway Load Balancer
		- Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS. E.g: firewall, intrusion detection, deep packet inspection system
		- operates at layer 3 (network layer) - IP packets
		- use GENEVE protocol on port 6081
- ## Sticky Sessions
	- to make same client be able to access same application
	- work with ALB, NLB
	- setup at [[aws/EC2/TG]]
- ## SSL Certificates
	- SNI (Server Name Indication) in TSL protocol allows browser to specify desired server name
- deck:: aws
- Connection draining/deregistration delay #card
	- a feature of ALB and NLB to allow in-flight requests to be gracefully completed before the in-game instance is fully deregistered
- ## Listeners
	- > check the incoming requests and protocol then route the traffic to its rules
- ## [[Practice]]
	- ALB
		- Launch EC2
			- select SG
			- launch 2 instances
		- Create ALB
			- Create SG
			- Attach to new [[aws/EC2/TG]] of prev instances
			- listener -> rule -> add rule
				- > by default, listener rule have an action to route traffic to TG
				- Add condition/matched then action: [Forward to TG/redirect/return fixed response]
