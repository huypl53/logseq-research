- > Auto Scaling Group
- be able to create new instance from provided Launch template
- add/remove EC2 in [[aws/EC2/TG]] obeyed the defined capacity (desired, min, max)
- like other nodes in AWS, [[aws/ec2/asg]] need to attach to a [[aws/SG]] for publishing port 80
- manual config
- dynamic config
	- use [[aws/CloudWatch/Alarms]], which trigger action in [[aws/EC2/ASG]] to add/remove unit capacity. Check result in history

- ## Metrics
	- CPUUtilization: Average CPU utilization across your instances
	- RequestCountPerTarget: to make sure the number of requests per EC2 instances is stable
	- Average Network In / Out (if youâ€™re application is network bound)
	- Any custom metric (that you push using CloudWatch)
- ## Scaling cooldown
	- During cooldown period, ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances
- ## Launch Template
	- AMI + Instance Type
	- EC2 User Data
	- EBS Volumes
	- Security Groups
	- SSH Key Pair
	- IAM Roles for your EC2 Instances
	- Network + Subnets Information
	- Load Balancer Information
- ## [[Practice]]
