## Improment
	- Attention-Centric Architecture: incorporating attention mechanisms to **capture long-range dependencies and contextual information** -> enhance object detection accuracy, especially in
	  **complex scenes.**
	- Area Attention Module: To mitigate the computational burden typically associated with attention (such as quadratic complexity and inefficient memory accesses)
		- This module divides the feature maps into **distinct areas**
	- Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation (R-ELAN): incorporating **residual connections** and a redesigned feature aggregation method
	- **Architectural Refinements:** Additional modifications include adjusting MLP ratios, removing positional encodings, and substituting linear operations with convolutional operators.
